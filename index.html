                    <p>The iconic JoJo's Bizzare Adventure Part 3: Stardust Crusaders began its serialization. Many consider this set of volumes to be where the series actually took off. It would shape the narrative and theme of other stories of this venture for years to come due to his introduction of "stands", user controlled abilities that take the form of humanoids or other anthropomorphics.</p>
